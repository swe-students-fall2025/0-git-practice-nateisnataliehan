## Key Takeaway I wanna Share
This article highlights how **AI is reshaping software development** by making complex data more accessible.  
One key point that resonated with me is the *democratization of data*. AI allows non-technical stakeholders to understand insights that were once hidden behind technical barriers.
I find this important because it fosters collaborative decision-making: developers, managers, and business users can now work together with shared understanding.

### Omer Hortig
I agree with **Natalie** that AI will allow broader participation in product development, yet I do believe that could also cause problems if someone without the proper context starts making changes in a codebase with AI. I think that in the future, making sure that teams have very strong governance practices will be essential as non-technical "new-comers" join the fray.
