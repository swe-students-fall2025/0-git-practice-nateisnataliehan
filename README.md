## Key Takeaway I wanna Share
This article highlights how **AI is reshaping software development** by making complex data more accessible.  
One key point that resonated with me is the *democratization of data*. AI allows non-technical stakeholders to understand insights that were once hidden behind technical barriers.
I find this important because it fosters collaborative decision-making: developers, managers, and business users can now work together with shared understanding.
